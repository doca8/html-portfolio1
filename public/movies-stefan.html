<h1>The Best Movies According to Stefan</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>My favorite Epic-Fantasy movie. Great characters , acting, fighting scenes.</p>
<h3>Castaway on the Moon</h3>
<p>Romantic-drama and very funny realistic story how we don't need money, only happiness. Also very bad movie for me to watch with a girlfriend because i usually break up
     with them after watching this movie :'D
</p>
<h3>The Old-Boy</h3>
<p>Great movie about loneliness</p>
